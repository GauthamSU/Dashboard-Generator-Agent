## Project Details

AI-powered automatic dashboard generator built using GenAI and the Llama-3.1-70b model. This innovative AI agent empowers users to create customizable, data-driven dashboards with just a csv file.

### *__Key features__*:

_Natural Language Processing_ : Understands the type of data and generates relevant visualizations. <br>
_Automated Data Integration_ : At present the agent only accepts csv file as data inputs but can easily be modified to support multiple data input sources such as databases and data warehouses. <br>
_Interactive Dashboards_ : Enables users to explore data dynamically.<br>

### *__Technology Used__* : <br><br>
__Languages__: Python, Typescript

__Backend__ :<br>
_Langchain_ : Used to fetch, parse and transform data into relevant format to generate plots for dashboard <br>
_Django-Ninja_ : Used to create API to accept the user data from frontend

__Frontend__ : <br>
_NextJs_ : To effectively route and send the user data to backend <br>
_React_ : To add interactivity and enhance user experience <br>
_Plotly_ : To display plots sent to web page from backend API <br>

__Skills__ : _LangChain_ 路 _Generative AI_ 路 _React.js_ 路 _Django_ 路 _TypeScript_

__Functionality__ : 
- The agent works with just a csv file for input
- Works more efficiently when metadata about the complete dataset is given and metadata about each of the columns is given.
- The agentic steps are as follows:
   * LLM first determines the nature of data from the csv data, metadata and column metadata
   * LLM then generates a JSON framework of different kinds of plots to create a convincing dashboard
   * The framework output is used to generate python code of plotly plots
   * The plotly plots are then executed and fixed of any errors.
   * The final plot is passed on to the frontend to display the final dashboard.
